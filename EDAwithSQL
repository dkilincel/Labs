# Summary of SQL Queries Performed

## Database Setup & Initialization
- Installed required libraries (`sqlalchemy`, `ipython-sql`).
- Connected to an **SQLite database** (`my_data1.db`).
- Created a **table named `SPACEXTABLE`** from the original dataset (`SPACEXTBL`).
- Ensured that all records have a valid **date** before storing them.

## Data Exploration Queries
- **Checked available columns** in the dataset using:
  ```sql
  PRAGMA table_info(SPACEXTABLE);
  ```
- **Counted total records** in the dataset:
  ```sql
  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM SPACEXTABLE;
  ```
- **Listed unique launch sites**:
  ```sql
  SELECT DISTINCT LaunchSite FROM SPACEXTABLE;
  ```
- **Retrieved first 5 records**:
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM SPACEXTABLE LIMIT 5;
  ```

## Descriptive Statistics
- **Calculated the number of successful vs. failed launches**:
  ```sql
  SELECT LaunchOutcome, COUNT(*) 
  FROM SPACEXTABLE 
  GROUP BY LaunchOutcome;
  ```
- **Analyzed yearly launch trends**:
  ```sql
  SELECT strftime('%Y', Date) AS Year, COUNT(*) 
  FROM SPACEXTABLE 
  GROUP BY Year 
  ORDER BY Year;
  ```
- **Identified the most frequently used launch sites**:
  ```sql
  SELECT LaunchSite, COUNT(*) 
  FROM SPACEXTABLE 
  GROUP BY LaunchSite 
  ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC;
  ```

## Advanced Queries
- **Filtered only successful launches**:
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM SPACEXTABLE 
  WHERE LaunchOutcome LIKE '%Success%';
  ```
- **Checked correlation between payload mass and success rate**:
  ```sql
  SELECT PayloadMass, LaunchOutcome 
  FROM SPACEXTABLE;
